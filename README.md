# Back-end lambda

<p>This repository was used to deploy a lambda container iamge to ECR. The lambda function used python and worked as a REST API together with AWS API Gateway. I used github actions to build the image on GitHub then pushed that image to AWS ECR, saving me quite a lot of time. </p>
